        <p>
          Below is a selection of projects I’ve developed over my 9+ months of
          coding. This highlights just a portion of the work I’ve done, as
          several other projects didn’t make the list. Some are still
          unfinished—either due to skill limitations at the time or because I
          pursued more engaging challenges. I plan to revisit and refine these
          projects in the future, enhancing their code with my current
          expertise.

          Error 404: No industry experience… yet! While I may not have
          professional experience, I bring over 9 months of hands-on coding and
          frontend development work through personal projects and self-driven
          learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          My projects have helped me build strong skills in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and React, along with a solid foundation in
          problem-solving, collaboration, and adaptability. I'm excited to apply
          my skills and passion for technology in a professional setting, where
          I can continue to grow and develop as a frontend developer.
